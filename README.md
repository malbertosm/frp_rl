## Introduction

Free random projection is a powerful technique that leverages concepts from free probability theory and random matrices. In the realm of reinforcement learning, this method can enhance the performance of various algorithms by providing more efficient state representations. This repository serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring these intersections.

## Installation

To get started with **frp_rl**, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frp_rl.git
   cd frp_rl
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have JAX installed. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

## Usage

After installation, you can run the main script to see the free random projection in action. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml
```

You can customize the configuration file to fit your needs. Check the `config.yaml` file for more options.

## Key Concepts

### Free Probability

Free probability theory is a branch of mathematics that studies non-commutative random variables. It plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of large random matrices and their applications in machine learning.

### In-Context Reinforcement Learning

In-context reinforcement learning refers to the ability of agents to learn from context rather than explicit rewards. This approach can lead to more efficient learning processes, especially in complex environments.

### JAX

JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library that enables automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU support. It is particularly useful for machine learning applications, allowing for faster experimentation and prototyping.

### Random Matrices

Random matrices are matrices whose entries are random variables. They are essential in understanding the properties of large datasets and have applications in various fields, including statistics and machine learning.

### Spectral Analysis

Spectral analysis involves studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices. This technique is critical in understanding the behavior of random matrices and their impact on learning algorithms.

### State-Space Model

A state-space model represents a system using state variables. In reinforcement learning, these models help in formulating the environment and understanding the dynamics of the agent's actions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement free random projection in a reinforcement learning setup:

```python
from frp_rl import FreeRandomProjection

frp = FreeRandomProjection()
frp.fit(data)
projected_data = frp.transform(data)
```

### Example 2: Advanced Configuration

For more advanced usage, you can customize the parameters in the `config.yaml` file. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```yaml
model:
  type: "frp"
  dimensions: 128
  epochs: 100
```
